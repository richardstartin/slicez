# slicez

Z-layout bit-sliced index for evaluating point and range queries over unsorted numerical data.

## Implementation

### Overview

SliceZ answers equality and range queries (`=`, `<`, `≤`, `>`, `≥`, `between`) over sequences of `long` values without sorting the data. It is a bit-sliced index in the tradition of O'Neil and Quass (1997). IEEE 754 doubles can be indexed by first mapping them to a total unsigned order with `FPOrdering.ordinalOf`.

### Data layout

Data is partitioned into **blocks** of 65,536 rows. Within each block, each 64-bit value is decomposed across 64 **slices** — one per bit position. Slice `i` is the set of rows for which bit `i` is set in the stored value.

Before bit-slicing, every value in the block is transformed:

```
stored = ~(value − blockMin)
```

where `blockMin` is the unsigned minimum of the block. The subtraction shifts the range down to start at zero; the bitwise NOT then inverts the ordering so that `blockMin` maps to `0xFFFF…FFFF` and values larger than `blockMin` map to smaller stored values. The practical effect is that all bit positions above the effective value range become all-ones in the stored representation, enabling them to be stored as **FULL slices** with zero payload.

Each slice is assigned one of four storage types based on its cardinality within the block:

| Type | Condition                                     | Payload |
|---|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| `FULL` | Every row has the bit set                     | None (2-bit header tag only) |
| `SPARSE` | Fewer than 4096 rows have the bit set         | `count` (2 B) + sorted row positions (2 B each) |
| `SPARSE_INVERTED` | Fewer than 4096 rows have the bit **clear** | `count` (2 B) + sorted complement positions (2 B each) |
| `DENSE` | Otherwise                                     | 1,024-byte flat bitset (16 × 64-bit words) |

The block header is 24 bytes: two 64-bit words (`typesHigh`, `typesLow`) encoding the 2-bit type for each of the 64 slices, plus the 64-bit `blockMin`.

### Query evaluation

Each query maintains a `Bits` accumulator — a 1,024-byte bitset with one bit per row in the block — and iterates its set bits to produce row indices.

**`≤ threshold` (and by inversion `> threshold`):** Anchors the threshold: `anchoredThreshold = threshold − blockMin`. Then traverses slices from bit 0 (LSB) to bit 63 (MSB):
- Threshold bit = 1 → union the slice into the accumulator (`buffer |= slice`)
- Threshold bit = 0 → intersect the slice into the accumulator (`buffer &= slice`)

Due to the `~(v − blockMin)` encoding this correctly evaluates `value ≤ threshold` in the original unsigned space.

**`firstRelevantSlice` optimization:** If a threshold bit is 1 and the slice for that bit is FULL, the union fills the accumulator unconditionally, destroying all prior work. The highest such bit is `firstRelevantSlice`; the query initialises the accumulator at that point and skips all lower slices, saving both iteration and slice decoding.

**`= value`:** Starts with a full accumulator and narrows it slice by slice over all non-FULL slices:
- Value bit = 1 → `buffer &= ~slice` (clear rows where the bit is absent)
- Value bit = 0 → `buffer &= slice` (clear rows where the bit is present)

If a slice would make the result empty, the rest of the block is skipped entirely.

**`between lower, upper`:** Decomposes into `NOT(value ≤ lower − 1) AND (value ≤ upper)`. Two accumulators are maintained in parallel (sharing slice reads where possible) and combined at the end as `~lower_buffer & upper_buffer` via `flipAnd`.

### Slice operations

Every accumulator operation is dispatched on slice type. Sparse operations iterate the stored position list directly. Dense operations work in 8-word strides and propagate `empty`/`full` sentinel flags so that subsequent operations can short-circuit without touching slice data. For example, once the accumulator is known to be empty, AND operations become no-ops; once it is full, union operations against FULL slices are no-ops.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks compare SliceZ against [`RangeBitmap`](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/RoaringBitmap) indexing **100 million** `long` values. The equality benchmark queries the median value; the range benchmark queries between the 50th and 51st percentile (a narrow 1-percentile window). All timings are average time in microseconds (lower is better).

### Distributions

| ID | Description |
|---|---|
| `UNIFORM_1` | Uniform random 64-bit longs |
| `UNIFORM_2` | Uniform random integers in [0, 100,000) scaled by 10,000 |
| `EXP_0_1` | Exponential distribution λ = 0.1 (mean ≈ 10, ~8 bits of range) |
| `DOUBLES` | Uniform random doubles in [0, 1) mapped to total unsigned order |
| `SAMPLED_PCS` | Synthetic profiler samples: 256 Zipf-distributed functions at a fixed userspace base address (top 17 bits fixed) |

### Equality query

|---|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM_1 | 6,748 | 17,695 | 2.6× |
| UNIFORM_2 | 7,431 | 12,866 | 1.7× |
| EXP_0_1 | 37,030 | 74,413 | 2.0× |
| DOUBLES | 6,870 | 17,740 | 2.6× |

### Range query (between 50th–51st percentile)

| Distribution | SliceZ (µs) | RangeBitmap (µs) | SliceZ speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM_1 | 41,150 | 51,060 | 1.2× |
| UNIFORM_2 | 23,240 | 59,341 | 2.6× |
| EXP_0_1 | 38,880 | 97,808 | 2.5× |
| DOUBLES | 39,486 | 48,260 | 1.2× |
| SAMPLED_PCS | 46,307 | 32,080 | 0.69× |

### Index size relative to raw data

| Distribution | SliceZ | RangeBitmap |
|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM_1 | 1.00× | 1.00× |
| UNIFORM_2 | 0.41× | 0.41× |
| EXP_0_1 | 0.61× | 0.10× |
| DOUBLES | 0.90× | 0.86× |
| SAMPLED_PCS | 0.76× | 0.36× |

### SliceZ slice type breakdown (totals across all blocks per dataset)

| Distribution | Dense | Full | Sparse | Sparse-Inverted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| UNIFORM_1 | 97,664 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| UNIFORM_2 | 39,676 | 57,988 | 0 | 0 |
| EXP_0_1 | 7,630 | 86,730 | 0 | 3,304 |
| DOUBLES | 85,531 | 11,249 | 743 | 141 |
| SAMPLED_PCS | 30,648 | 64,092 | 0 | 2,924 |

`UNIFORM_1` has no FULL slices because uniformly random 64-bit data populates all bit positions. `EXP_0_1` is dominated by FULL slices: with values concentrated in roughly 8 bits, the remaining 56 high-order bits are all-zero in the original data and become all-ones after `~(v − blockMin)`, yielding FULL slices with no payload. `UNIFORM_2` similarly has ~38 FULL slices per block from the high-order zero bits and from the trailing zero bits introduced by the ×10,000 factor.

The `SAMPLED_PCS` distribution is the one case where SliceZ is slower. Profiler addresses have the top 17 bits fixed (→ FULL slices, no benefit to query cost) but the remaining 47 bits span varied code addresses, all falling into dense slices. RangeBitmap compresses this distribution 2× better than SliceZ, and its representation aligns better with the narrow inter-percentile query range.
